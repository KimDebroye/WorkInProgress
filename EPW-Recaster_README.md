## In a nutshell
EPW Recaster is a tool that
- automates recasting EPW weapons & gears (_armors_)
- using Optical Character Recognition and
- user-configurable search conditions.
> *EPW Recaster does not rely on nor uses any kind of game hook.<br />It solely relies on what is captured using OCR and performs<br />programmatorical choices & actions based on captured results.*

### General Notes
> - Once a preview or an auto-roll is started, the main form will be programmatically minimized and restored after.<br />( *The main form is mainly used for setup purposes only.* )
> - On the other hand, the info form will always stay on top of all windows.
> - All changes are automatically stored and restored upon relaunch.
> - Using any kind of text editor, theming options can be altered in<br />`.\Config\ThemeColorStyle.cfg` (*includes additional comments*).

### 1. ( Main ) Setup Form

___

#### 1-1. See-through Region

![See-through Region](https://snipboard.io/KETSjh.jpg)

- When launching EPW Recaster for the first time<br />( *and/or whenever the in-game location of the recast<br />a.k.a. reshape/manufacture window is changed* ),
- **move the tool around and resize using the size grip handle**<br />in order for:
  - the see-through region to fit the in-game recast<br />a.k.a. reshape/manufacture window,
  - the 3 tiny squares ( *hinting click regions* )<br />to be located somewhere over the in-game buttons<br />( `Retain the old attribute` |`Reproduce` | `Use the new attribute` ),
  - the capture region to fit the text to be captured.
    - **The fitting does not need to be pixel perfect in order for the Optical Character Recognition to work properly.**
      - Although this can ( *usually* ) be safely ignored, try to avoid any additional UI elements contained in the captured region.<br />Reason: Depending on the fitting, parts of the in-game UI could be detected as a character<br />( *f.e. the in-game scroll up icon may be detected as capital 'A'* ).
    - **[ ! ] Without any actual game file alterations ( *`configs.pck`* ),<br />it is not recommended to use EPW Recaster<br />to look for stats on weapons that have unique (*long descriptive*) stats**,<br />unless it's (*one of those*) unique stats being targeted in a roll.
      - *In other words*, avoid looking for stats on weapons having<br />`Purify Spell`, `God of Frenzy`, `Square Formation`, `Soul Shatter`, `Spirit Blackhole`, ...<br />as a possible stat in order not to miss a stat needing an in-game scroll<br />(*unless the previously mentioned stats are being specifically targeted*).

___

#### 1-2. Capture Region

![Capture Region](https://snipboard.io/gimUN4.jpg)

- ( *A visible preview of* )
- The region setting the boundaries used for Optical Character Recognition.
- Depending in which mode the process will be started, the capture region will either be located:
	- **Preview Mode : full width of see-through region** and a little above the in-game buttons.
	- **Roll Mode : right half of see-through region** and a little above the in-game buttons.

___

___

#### 1-5. Condition Entry (Entries)
- In order to enlist a roll condition:
  - Select a preferred amount and preferred stat to be found.
    - (Optional) Select up to 3 additional preferred amounts and preferred stats to be found/combined.
      - Once a second preferred stat has been selected from the drop-down list,<br />a checkbox to ignore amounts becomes available.<br />If checked, the entry would become a combo entry ( _allowing any amount of selected stats although limiting a roll to only contain the selected stats_ ).
  - Click the green `+` sign.
- Any previously added condition can be removed<br />by pressing the red `x` in the condition list.

> Additional Notes
>
>- **Ignore white stats, only blue stats are to be taken into account**.<br />
>  ( *f.e.* `4 x Phys. Res.` *= max, ignoring the fifth white Phys. Res. stat on a gear* ) 
>- When (*accidentally*) adding an amount larger than 1 of a unique stat ( *f.e. `Purify Spell`* ),<br />it will instead be enlisted as `1 x`.
>- When (*accidentally*) adding a summed amount exceeding the max stats possible,<br />it will instead be enlisted as either `4 x` or `5 x` ( _Atk. & Def. only_ ).
>- Using any kind of text editor, the list of selectable stat options can be altered in<br />`.\Config\Stats.cfg` (*includes additional comments*).

## FAQ

> **Question: "The tool doesn't seem to work for me ... what do I do, doc ?**"<br />
> **Symptoms**: "_No valid roll information detected (yet)._" | "_... doesn't seem necessary to roll any further ... halted ..._" | "_Threw my pc out of the window..._" | ...

➥ **Answer**:
- **In general, each capture/roll produces a logged text and image file that may be worth checking in case it would be an OCR related issue.**<br />Check [ 2.2. Log Folder ](https://github.com/KimDebroye/EPW-Recaster#2-2-log-folder) for more information.
- **It doesn't click/reproduce a roll.**
  - **It's most certainly an admin privilege issue.**<br />Check [ Setup > Developer Note ](https://github.com/KimDebroye/EPW-Recaster#setup) for instructions on how to enable administrative privileges.
    - **[ Developer Note ]** This fixed it for most I've been chatting with that had this issue.<br />If many encounter this, I may include code in an update<br />to elevate administrative privileges programmatically ( _hoping it would skip the manual fix_ ).
  - **Additionally, make sure the capture region has been sized/positioned correctly.**
- **It does click/reproduce a roll but still stops a batch roll after a short while.**
  - **May as well be a timing issue.** On older or _trying-to-avoid-what-fries-and-chips-are-made-of-word_ computers,<br />maybe best to also increase timings ( _add about 500~xxxx milliseconds to timings of choice_ ).<br />Check [ 2-4. Preview | Roll Mode ](https://github.com/KimDebroye/EPW-Recaster#setup) for the config file location.
  - Also, keep in mind that ( _at time of writing_ ) older re-rollable gears ( _Primal / Nirvana / ..._ )<br />don't produce in-game roll results as fast as R8 ones,<br />so also for this purpose it would be best to increase timings.<br />If needed, change the `Await Accept/Reject Action` timing to around 3750 milliseconds.
- **Inform me when the above does not provide a solution to the issue.**
